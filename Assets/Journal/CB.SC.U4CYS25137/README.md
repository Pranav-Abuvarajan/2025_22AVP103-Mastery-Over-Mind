# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
To my senior from MBA:
As a kid who had never traveled by train before, I honestly had no idea how train schedules worked or how chaotic railway stations could be. Everything about train travel was new and confusing to me. The long platforms, the endless announcements, and the constant rush of people moving in every direction were all overwhelming. When I was returning home from my hometown in Tamil Nadu to my university, my parents had booked a train ticket for me to Coimbatore. During my earlier journey home, many of my classmates had traveled with me, making the experience smooth and enjoyable. We chatted, shared snacks, and passed the time easily, so I never really paid attention to the details of train timings or connections. However, things were very different on my return trip. This time, none of my classmates were traveling back with me, and I had to manage everything on my own. Once I reached Coimbatore, I learned that my next train to Ettimadai wouldn’t leave for another eight hours. The only available trains were at 10 A.M. and 8 P.M., and I had arrived much earlier than that. The realization hit me hard; I would have to wait alone at the busy Coimbatore station for hours, with all my luggage and growing anxiety. I was worried because I had to report back to the university soon for check-in, and I didn’t want to be late. I sat there feeling uncertain and slightly panicked, trying to figure out what to do next. That’s when something unexpected happened. The girl sitting next to me on the bench noticed my confusion and started a conversation. She had a kind smile and spoke in a calm, friendly tone that immediately put me at ease. During our chat, she mentioned that she was a senior at Amrita University—the same place where I studied! She quickly understood my situation and advised me to take a cab directly to the campus instead of waiting for the next train. What surprised me even more was that she offered to share the ride with me since she was heading back to the university as well. Relieved and grateful, I agreed. We booked a cab together, and the journey that had seemed so stressful moments before turned into a pleasant experience. We talked about college life and her experiences as a senior. She even gave me some valuable advice about managing studies and hostel life. By the time we reached campus, I felt not only safe but also inspired. Looking back, I realized how lucky I was to have met her that day. She turned what could have been a long and anxious wait into a comfortable and memorable trip. I even ended up saving some money by sharing the cab fare. I’m genuinely thankful for her kindness and for the way fate brought her into my path at just the right time. It reminded me that help can come from the most unexpected places when you need it the most.

To my discord friend:
I am a big fan of video games. Gaming has always been my favorite way to relax, explore, and enjoy the joy of my childhood. I especially love retro games—those classic, pixelated titles that shaped the early years of gaming. There’s something special about the simplicity and charm of older games; they remind me of a time when storytelling and gameplay felt genuine and heartfelt. However, many of these retro games can’t be played on modern systems anymore, making it both challenging and exciting for me to track them down.

One day, while browsing gaming forums, I found a game called Celeste. The name immediately caught my eye. As I read more about it, I learned it was a platformer with a deep emotional story about perseverance and overcoming personal struggles. I was eager to try it for myself. However, I faced a problem—I couldn’t find a reliable source to download it.

Even though Celeste wasn’t expensive—it cost around $2.45—it was surprisingly hard to find. The specific version I wanted was rare and not available on most sites I usually check. I searched everywhere I could think of, from old gaming archives to community forums, but every link I found was either broken, restricted, or led to unsafe downloads. My frustration started to build. What made it worse was that I had been so excited about it that I couldn’t focus on anything else.

For the next few days, I felt really down. It might sound dramatic, but gaming is very personal to me—it’s not just a hobby; it’s a source of comfort. Not being able to find Celeste left me feeling strangely empty, so much that I stopped hanging out with my online friends for a while. I knew it was a small issue in the grand scheme of life, but it mattered to me.

Then, unexpectedly, something wonderful happened. One of my friends on Discord—someone I had met on a creative writing server—reached out to me. We had connected over our shared interests in storytelling and games, and she was always kind and understanding. I casually mentioned my struggle to find Celeste, not expecting much. To my surprise, she replied a few hours later with a direct link. She had found a clean, unencrypted version of the game from her region, Qatar, where it was still available for download.

I could hardly believe it. I immediately downloaded the game, and when it finally started running smoothly on my screen, I felt a wave of joy and relief. It was a small gesture from her, but it meant a lot to me. The fact that she went out of her way to help me find something that made me happy was incredibly touching.

That day reminded me how meaningful online friendships can be. Sometimes, kindness comes from people you’ve never met in person, yet they understand and support you in unexpected ways. I was—and still am—deeply grateful to her for helping me experience Celeste, not just as a game, but as a symbol of friendship and generosity.

To my Best Friend 

I have a lot of friends, honestly, too many to count. Most of them are more like acquaintances because I tend to forget small details about people easily. But among them, there are a few who are truly special to me; these are the ones I consider my real friends. They understand me in ways that words can’t express and always support me when I need it most.

One Sunday, a few of us decided to go to a movie at Brookefields. It was one of those carefree days when everything felt light and fun. We laughed through the movie, shared snacks, and simply enjoyed each other’s company. Afterward, since we still had some time before heading back to campus, we chose to explore the nearby MINISO store.

As we wandered through the aisles filled with cute and colorful items, something instantly caught my eye: a beautiful Pokémon toy. It was small, detailed, and absolutely perfect. Pokémon has always meant a lot to me; it represents my childhood—the cartoons I grew up with, the games I played for hours, and the sense of adventure and imagination that shaped me. Seeing that toy brought back all those nostalgic memories, and for a moment, I wished I could take it home.

But when I checked the price, I realized I didn’t have enough money with me. I felt a little embarrassed and disappointed. I tried to act normal, but my mood had already dropped. My friend noticed right away. He’s one of those people who can easily sense when something’s bothering you, even without you saying a word. Though I didn’t explain much, he somehow understood why I was feeling down.

We soon left the store and returned to the university as the day ended. I didn’t think much about it after that, but exactly a week later, something truly heartwarming happened. My friend came up to me with a small, neatly wrapped package and handed it to me with a grin. When I opened it, I was speechless; it was the same Pokémon toy I had admired at MINISO!

That thoughtful gesture completely made my day. I felt overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness—not just because I got the toy, but because someone cared enough to remember such a small detail that meant so much to me. In that moment, I realized how genuine and kind he was, and that’s how we truly became best friends.

Even now, every time I see that Pokémon toy, I think of that day and the beautiful bond we share. It’s a simple story, but it taught me how powerful small acts of kindness can be. I deeply appreciate him for his thoughtfulness and for being such a wonderful friend.
