# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
1-TO MY MBA SENIOR
As a kid who had never traveled by train before, I had no idea how train schedules worked or how chaotic railway stations could be. Everything about train travel was new and confusing to me, including the long platforms, endless announcements, and the constant rush of people moving in every direction. When I was returning home from my hometown in Tamil Nadu to my university, my parents carefully booked a train ticket for me to Coimbatore. During my earlier journey home, I had many classmates traveling with me, so the experience was smooth and enjoyable. We chatted, shared snacks, and passed the time easily. I never really paid attention to the details of train timings or connections.

However, things were very different on my return trip. This time, none of my classmates were traveling back with me, and I had to manage everything on my own. Once I reached Coimbatore, I realized that my next train to Ettimadai wouldn’t be leaving for another eight hours. The next available trains were only at 10 A.M. and 8 P.M., and I had arrived much earlier than that. The realization hit me hard—I would have to wait alone at the busy Coimbatore station for hours, with all my luggage and growing anxiety. I also worried because I had to report back to the university soon for check-in, and I didn’t want to be late.

I sat there feeling uncertain and slightly panicked, trying to figure out what to do next. That’s when something unexpected happened. The girl sitting next to me on the bench noticed my confusion and started a conversation. She had a kind smile and spoke in a calm, friendly tone that immediately put me at ease. During our chat, she mentioned that she was a senior at Amrita University—the same place where I studied! She quickly understood my situation and advised me to take a cab directly to the campus instead of waiting for the next train. What surprised me even more was that she offered to share the ride with me since she was heading back to the university as well.

Relieved and grateful, I agreed. We booked a cab together, and the journey that had seemed stressful moments before turned into a pleasant experience. We talked about college life, her experiences as a senior, and she even gave me some valuable advice about managing studies and hostel life. By the time we reached campus, I felt not only safe but also inspired.

Looking back, I realized how lucky I was to have met her that day. She turned what could have been a long and anxious wait into a comfortable and memorable trip. I even ended up saving some money by sharing the cab fare. I’m genuinely grateful for her kindness and for how fate brought her into my path at just the right time. It reminded me that help can come from the most unexpected places when you need it the most.

2-TO MY DISCORD FRIEND
I am an avid video game enjoyer. Gaming has always been my favorite escape — a way to unwind, explore, and relive the joy of my childhood. I have a particular fondness for retro games — those classic, pixelated titles that defined the early days of gaming. There’s something incredibly special about the simplicity and charm of older games; they remind me of a time when storytelling and gameplay were pure and heartfelt. Unfortunately, many of these retro games can’t be played natively on modern systems anymore, which makes tracking them down both challenging and exciting for me.

One day, while browsing through some gaming forums, I came across a title called Celeste. The name instantly caught my attention. As I read more about it, I discovered it was a platformer with a deep emotional story about perseverance and overcoming one’s inner struggles. I was immediately drawn to it and wanted to experience it for myself. However, there was a problem — I couldn’t find a reliable source to download it.

Although Celeste wasn’t an expensive game — it only cost around $2.45 — it was surprisingly difficult to find. The specific version I wanted was rare and not available on most of the sites I usually visit. I searched everywhere I could think of, from old gaming archives to community forums, but every link I found was either broken, restricted, or led to unsafe downloads. The frustration slowly started to build up. What made it worse was that I had been so excited about it that I couldn’t think about anything else.

For the next few days, I felt quite dejected. It may sound dramatic, but gaming is something deeply personal to me — it’s not just a hobby; it’s a source of comfort. Not being able to find Celeste left me feeling oddly empty, so much so that I stopped hanging out with my online friends for a while. I knew it was a small thing in the grand scheme of life, but it mattered to me.

Then, out of the blue, something wonderful happened. One of my friends on Discord — someone I had met on a creative writing server — reached out to me. We had bonded over shared interests in storytelling and games, and she was always kind and understanding. I casually mentioned my struggle with finding Celeste, not expecting much. To my surprise, she replied a few hours later with a direct link. She had managed to get a clean, unencrypted version of the game from her region, Qatar, where it was still available for download.

I could hardly believe it. I immediately downloaded the game, and when it finally started running smoothly on my screen, I felt this surge of joy and relief. It was a small gesture from her, but it meant a lot to me. The fact that she went out of her way to help me find something that made me happy was incredibly touching.

That day reminded me how meaningful even online friendships can be. Sometimes, kindness comes from people you’ve never met in person, yet they understand and support you in ways you don’t expect. I was — and still am — deeply grateful to her for helping me experience Celeste, not just as a game, but as a symbol of friendship and generosity.

3-TO MY BEST FRIEND

I have quite a few friends, honestly, too many to count. Most of them are more like acquaintances because I tend to forget small details about people easily. But among them, there are a few who are truly special to me; they are my real friends. They understand me in ways that words can’t express and always look out for me when I need it most.

One fine Sunday, a few of us decided to go see a movie at Brookefields. It was one of those carefree days when everything feels light and fun. We laughed during the movie, shared snacks, and simply enjoyed each other’s company. Afterward, since we still had some time before going back to campus, we decided to check out the nearby MINISO store.

As we wandered through the aisles filled with cute and colorful items, something instantly caught my eye: a beautiful Pokémon toy. It was small, detailed, and absolutely perfect. Pokémon has always held a special place in my heart; it represents my entire childhood— the cartoons I grew up watching, the games I played for hours, and the sense of adventure and imagination that shaped me. Seeing that toy brought back all those nostalgic memories, and for a moment, I really wished I could take it home.

But when I checked the price, I realized I didn’t have enough money with me. I felt a little embarrassed and disappointed. I tried to brush it off and act normal, but my mood had dropped. My friend noticed right away. He’s one of those people who can easily sense when something’s bothering you, even if you don’t say a word. Though I didn’t explain much, he somehow understood why I was feeling low.

We soon left the store and returned to the university as the day came to an end. I didn’t think much about it after that, but exactly a week later, something truly heartwarming happened. My friend approached me with a small, neatly wrapped package and handed it to me with a grin. When I opened it, I was speechless—it was the same Pokémon toy I had admired at MINISO!

That thoughtful gesture completely made my day. I felt overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness—not just because I got the toy, but because someone cared enough to remember such a small thing that meant so much to me. In that moment, I realized how genuine and kind he was, and that’s how we truly became best friends.

Even now, every time I see that Pokémon toy, it reminds me of that day and the wonderful bond we share. It’s a simple story, but it taught me how powerful small acts of kindness can be. I deeply appreciate him for his thoughtfulness and for being such a great friend.
